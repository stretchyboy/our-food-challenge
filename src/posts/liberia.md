### Key Traditional Liberian Drinks

*    Palm Wine: Freshly tapped from palm trees, this sweet, milky, and slightly alcoholic beverage is a staple at social gatherings.
*    Ginger Beer (Liberian Ginger-Ade): A refreshing and spicy drink made from blended ginger, pineapple peelings, sugar, and sometimes yeast for fermentation.
*    Kane-Juice (Cane Juice): A high-proof, locally distilled spirit made from sugar cane, often called "country whiskey".
*    Pine-wine: A drink derived from pineapple, sometimes used interchangeably with or similar to pineapple-infused ginger beer.
*    Local Fruit Juices: Freshly made juices from mango, citrus, and other local fruits are common.
